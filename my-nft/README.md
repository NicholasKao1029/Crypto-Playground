## Builds off of `hello-world-smart-contracts` folder

## Barebones implementation of NFT fun

- Contract deployment
    - inherit zepplins EIP-721 implementation
        - https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721
    - create contract with function to mint NFT

- Deploy contract

- Mint NFT using IPFS (Pinata helps)
    - NOTE: This implementation uses web3 another repo uses Ether.js (from one stack overflow post it seems Ether is more favored)
